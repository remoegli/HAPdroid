/** 
 *	\file heapsort.h
 *	\brief Include file for heapsort algorithm modified for use with array sets.
 *
 *	<b>Motgivation</b>
 *	The C++ STL implements sorting for the class list. This class represents a
 *	linear list, but is built as a double-linked list. Such an implementation is not
 *	very efficient for large data sets in respect to space and time complexity.
 *
 *	<b>Approach</b>
 *	This implementation of a sort function can be applied to sets of arrays that 
 *	implement linear lists by C arrays. The sorting works equally well indedependent
 *	of the prior order of elements.
 *	Array sets are used in such a way that for a set of n arrays a list of n-tuples
 *	are managed where each element of a tuple is an array entry for a particular
 *	index value.
 *
 * 	This file is subject to the terms and conditions defined in
 * 	files 'BSD.txt' and 'GPL.txt'. For a list of authors see file 'AUTHORS'.
